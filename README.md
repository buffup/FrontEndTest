# Buff UP LTD React Dev. Test

# The Task:

Display our Buff component as an overlay of the video HTML element.

Build a TimeInput component with the following format `mm:ss` which will define the countdown in our Buff component and a submit button. The minimum time allowed to answer should be 5 seconds `00:05` and the maximum is 2 minutes `02:00`

### UI

The Buff component and the video component should look like this:

![Buff](Buff.png)

The Time input component should look like this

![TimeInput](TimeInput.png)

- [ ] The countdown timer should work and at the end if the user hasn't yet voted, the question should automatically hide

- [ ] We should be able to select different times according to the restrictions and that should reflect on the countdown timer.

- [ ] When the user selects an answer, the correct answer should be highlighted letting the user know if they got it right (UI of your choice)

## What we are looking for:

- Demonstration of coding style and design patterns.
- Error handling.
- Any form of unit testing you see fit.
- Use the design provided as a guidance, we are not expecting a pixel perfect solution.

## How to Submit your solution:

- Clone this repository
- Create a repo in github, bitbucket or a suitable alternative and provide a link to the repository.
- Provide a readme in markdown which details of your code and any libraries that you may have used (feel free to use any libraries you see fit)
- Explain how we should test the solution

Good luck!
